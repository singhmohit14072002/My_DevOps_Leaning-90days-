# My_DevOps_Leaning(90 days)
I’m embarking on a DevOps journey, starting on March 19th and concluding on June 19. During this period, I’ll explore DevOps tools, principles, and practices. My goal is to gain expertise in continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and infrastructure as code. Additionally, I plan to pursue DevOps certifications to validate my skills.
