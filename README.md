# My_DevOps_Leaning-90days-
I’m embarking on a DevOps journey, starting March 2nd and concluding on April 30th. During this period, I’ll explore DevOps tools, principles, and practices. My goal is to gain expertise in continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and infrastructure as code. Additionally, I plan to pursue DevOps certifications to validate my skills.
